# LIST_Tools_Pro_Addin

This ESRI Addin toolbar, for ArcGIS Pro provides quick access to theLIST. These services are focused on the Australian state of Tasmania. Also included is a tool to syncronize Google Earth with ArcGIS Pro. 
This Addin is provided by [Land Tasmania](http://nre.tas.gov.au/land-tasmania).

[**TheLIST**](https://www.thelist.tas.gov.au/app/content/home)  is a contemporary online service that provides access to integrated land and property information service. [LISTMap](https://maps.thelist.tas.gov.au/listmap/app/list/map) allows users to view and create maps from hundreds of authoritative spatial datasets, and find out more about the information shown on those maps.

Spatial datasets include natural resources, roads, community facilities, property boundaries (cadastre), aerial imagery and survey information.

LISTMap is publicly available through your computer's web browser or via your mobile device.

For more detailed information on how to access LIST web services, see the following [LIST spatial web services users guide](https://www.thelist.tas.gov.au/app/content/the-list/news_and_information/resources/list_spatial_web_services_user_guide.pdf)

## History

The ESRI-Addin presented here was created within the GIS Systems and Development (Spatial Operations) section of the [Heritage and Land Tasmania](http://nre.tas.gov.au/land-tasmania) Division within the Department [Natural Resources and Environment](http://nre.tas.gov.au/) Tasmania (formally Primary Industries Parks Water and Environment DPIPWE) within  the state government of Tasmania, Australia. This add-in was developed to support internal clients. We used the new capabilities of ArcGIS to improve upon the functionality offered in our earlier Add-in for ArcMap: LIST_Tools_ArcMap_Addin. 


## Disclaimer

LIST_Tools_Pro_Addin is released to the wider community “as-is”. Although our testing and usage has been extensive, this experience has been with a limited number of different computer environments. Thus we cannot guarantee in any way that it will work the same way in your environment. Bear in mind that these tools have been developed primarily for internal NRE staff, and hence our ability to provide support to external users is limited.
